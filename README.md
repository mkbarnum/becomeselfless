# Become Selfless Website

On a terminal (perhaps in VSCode), change to the directory you want to store this github repo in and then run the below command.

`gh repo clone mkbarnum/becomeselfless`

If you don't have github setup on your computer, visit https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/github-cli/github-cli/quickstart.

You should then be able to open the becomeselfless folder in VS Code and make changes to the code.

To test your changes, just open a browser and open the index.html file (i.e. file:///Users/matbarnu/Personal/becomeselfless/index.html).

Once changes are ready, push them to GitHub and then we can upload to the AWS S3 bucket that hosts the website code.
