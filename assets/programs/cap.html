                        The purpose of the College Assistance Program (CAP) is to help guide individuals to lifelong self-sufficiency by providing supplemental funds to attend a 4-year university as well as by providing individualized career coaching and training for financial literacy and life skills. Participants will work with qualified professionals to create and follow a budget, as well as receive additional career counseling and coaching as needed. A coach will help determine the amount of funds needed, to supplement any earnings or savings the recipient has, to pay for costs such as: tuition, fees, books, supplies, room, board, travel, and transportation expenses.

                    <p class="lead text-left" style = 'color: black;' >
                        The SELFLESS College Assistance Program (CAP) is a unique opportunity for individuals seeking to improve their lives and become self-sufficient by attending a 4-year university.
                    <br><br>
                        This is <b>not</b> a traditional scholarship program. SELFLESS does not award predetermined amounts as part of the CAP program. If you are selected as a recipient, you will meet with a coach to review your finances and determine the amount to be awarded each semester based on your personal needs. Recipients will be required to apply for FAFSA (fafsa.gov) and are encouraged to work a part-time job while attending school. As a recipient, you will also have the opportunity to receive coaching and counseling from qualified professionals about financial literacy, career choices, and other personal matters as needed. This program is designed to enable recipients to graduate from school without debt, improve their future career potential, and have the financial management knowledge necessary to be self-sufficient throughout their life.
                    <br><br>
                        The SELFLESS is to help as many families and individuals as possible. To accomplish this, we strongly encourage recipients to attend Brigham Young University, either in Provo, UT or Rexburg, ID. Both schools offer an excellent education at a reasonable price (BYU is listed #6 for Best Value Schools: U.S. Universities). If you do not wish to attend one of these schools, recipients may also enroll in BYU Pathway or the BYU Flex program for a year to gain Utah residency prior to transferring to another school in Utah, such as Utah Valley University or Utah State University. If you have already been accepted to a school or have plans to attend a different school, please specify this in your application. Your choice of school will be taken into consideration when evaluating your application. Exceptions to the above guidelines may be made on a case-by-case basis. If you think that your situation merits an exception, please explain this in your 2nd essay (Self-Sufficiency Essay) and it will be considered.
